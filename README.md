## About

This is a simple HTML-JS application to help the study. I have used simpler console Python version, but I decided to make a port in more flexible language with a UI. The main purpose is to provide a virtual version of the [Leitner system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system).

## Getting Started

The project is built with plain JS and HTML, for simplicity and compatibility. To use the application simply of `index.html` in your favorite browser.

- Insert files in CSV format in provided input form

- Get questions and answer

- Once done, remember to use **SAVE** to make a copy of the modified files in local system
